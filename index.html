            <p>Live-in-Labs速 is a multidisciplinary experiential learning program that breaks classroom and lab barriers by applying learned theory in real-world settings. This credit-based academic program draws on principles of lean research for the development and deployment of sustainable solutions for current challenges faced by rural communities in India. By directly living in rural communities (labs) and co-designing solutions to development challenges, program participants gain first-hand knowledge and know-how of identifying and assessing community needs and subsequently developing and implementing viable solutions through various participatory methods.</p>

            <p>Launched by the President of India, Sri Ram Nath Kovind, on October 8th 2017, the Jivamritam Purified Clean Drinking Water Initiative aims to install drinking water filtration systems in 5,000 villages and provide clean drinking water to over 10 million people throughout India. The Jivamritam project utilizes a community cost-sharing model for the operation and sustainable management of the systems.

Amrita faculty and students are currently working to deploy the Jivamritam water filtration systems through the Live-in-Labs速 program. The project includes applied research in the geographical distribution of water contaminants, filtration techniques and processes, awareness programs, and community empowerment strategies.</p>
